Junior developer. I have been studying programming since 2016, started in high school with Pascal. Nowadays i'm working as `Junior JavaScript developer` in [Carely.group](https://carely.group): develop and support parsing scripts. I also enjoy UI design: like to make templates for my pet projects in Figma. Also studying `React` and `NodeJS`.
